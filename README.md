#  👨🏻‍💻 Hello I'm Jorge

◾ 🖥️ I've worked on and enjoy Angular and Flutter, but feel most comfortable with .NET. 
◾ 🧮 Current role is working with Power BI so I'm very familiar with DAX and Power Query(M).
◾ 🧱 I like SQL and have been getting more familiar with Python, specifically PySpark. 
◾ 💡 Fun fact: I'm a USMC veteran
